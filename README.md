# social-network-api

## MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, we have used several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important to understand how to build and structure the API first.

The challenge for this homework was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Installation

In order to use this application, you will have to run an npm start from the cloned down repository to get the code running on your localhost server. Once that is running, you'll have to open Insomnia to run the routes to test all the code. You can find all the code from the URL here:
